# GrossPayCalculator

Currently, this app will take the input or hours worked and rate of pay and calculate the weekly, monthly and early gross pay. 

Overtime is automatically calculated for over 40 hours.

Just put in hours worked for the week,i.e 45 hours (5 hours is automatically considered overtime)

Input your rate of pay, i.e. 10 (for $10.00 and hour)

The weekly, monthly and yearly pay gross is calculated

Pretty handy hen you want to get an idea of what your pay is going to be.

Can be used to help you figure out how many hours you need at what rate to determine your pay in pay negotiations.
